I’m the loud one who has sort of put this bunch of riders together.

Originally from the North West, but currently living in Ipswich with my fiancée Karen and her daughter Leah. Our wedding was put slightly on hold for this trip, so a big thanks to my intended Karen.

I have been cycling for the last 10 years and this will be my second time doing the trip, the last was in 2014 heading north from Lands’ End. I have done numerous sportives and 12 Triathlons. Getting round is the achievement, and I’ll do anything for a medal, a bit like Muttley, that well known dog.

I recently joined Ipswich bike club and regularly go out on a Saturday averaging about 40 miles a session with Sean (racing snake) and Steve (peppermint tea boy). Bit of a sports nut and will watch anything on a cold winters night. Thank god for Sky sports.

### Dave

Having done a few endurance events in the past I was looking for something else to challenge myself. I tried to enter the London Marathon a few times, but failed to successfully obtain a place in the ballot. But when it comes to running, I perhaps have to admit that I don’t really have the legs to do it.

Ive always enjoyed riding, often out with family on a few leisure rides and the odd commute to work. So when I was asked if would consider joining up to do the John O Groats to Lands End…I quite surprised myself by saying yes.

Despite the early morning rides, the hills and more hills I have really enjoyed the time in the saddle. The peace and quiet is a big draw, but not to sure how much of that will be present on the ride…!

2017 is going to be a big year. Hit the magic 40 and what better way to look back with this with the 10 day journey under my belt as well. Going to miss my very understanding wife, and kids - who are under strict instructions to have a pasty and a pint ready for I cross the line. But 10 days away raising money for some fantastic charities will be a small price to pay knowing that we are helping those not so lucky in life.

### Steve

As a late arrival into the Knights team I'm still getting my head round a 1,200 mile bike ride. I'm the youngest member, just, at 39! So there is really no excuses for me not to be fit and ready for this adventure of a lifetime. I've been cycling with Nigel & Sean for a while now and we are all cycling mad, although Sean probably tops the table there.

I live in Ipswich with my wife and son. I drink a lot of peppermint tea and eat a lot of bananas and chicken drumsticks. I could explain why, but its a long and boring explanation. As its getting towards winter right now I'm probably topping out at about 10 cups or peppermint tea a day.
 This doesn't come easy, it takes training and commitment to get to that level of tea drinking. Apart from going on bike rides I also love watching the pro peloton race usually via Eurosport, hour after hour of not much happening is strangely relaxing. When I'm not working and cycling I love a good box set or strumming my guitar.

My current winter training regime for JOGLE is a bit adhoc. I try to do 1 or 2 spin classes at the gym each week. I like being shouted at whilst listening to Little Mix. I try and brave the cold with a mid week ride with the boys and a Saturday morning club ride when I can make it. But to be honest I’m a fair weather cyclist so not a big fan of winter training.
