Training outside in the winter can be a miserable experience.  Apart from the cold, wet and darkness, debris on the roads makes a visit from the puncture fairy much more likely.

The alternative has usually been time spent with your bike attached to a stationary turbo trainer, staring at a wall and trying desperately to ignore the constant effort. Time does not fly.

Recently things have massively improved though with the introduction of [Zwift](https://www.zwift.com), an online cycling game. Zwift let's you link your smart trainer to the game where it will adjust the resistance as you climb or descend. It will even change the 'feel' of the road as you ride over the coble stones or pontoon decking of it's sun drenched island [Watopia](http://zwiftblog.com/map/) or the trafficless streets of London.

Bill, Steve and I have been talking about escaping the winter and setting up an indoor ride for a while now.  Last night became the first of what will hopefully become our regular winter group training sessions in Bill's garage, complete with open door.

Seeing yourself move on a laptop screen seems to be just enough to convince the brain that you're actually riding outside somewhere. Seeing a virtual Steve take a turn on the front of the group only reinforces the illusion.

Zwift has group racing complete with drafting or structured training sessions.  Living in flat(tish) Suffolk having a private indoor mountain to train on is also pretty useful.
