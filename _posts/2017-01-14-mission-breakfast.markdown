Many people find January to be a cold, dark month after all the fun of Christmas
but for London's homeless and marginalised it can be a particularly hard time of
year.

As the temperature drops volunteer services such as the [Whitechapel
Mission](https://whitechapel.org.uk/) provide vital help to many who would have
no where else to turn. Something as simple as a hot meal can make all the
difference to how someone views their day.

Baggy, Mike and Nigel have been putting in time to help out with Mission's
breakfast duties serving over 300 people.

What does that entail?  Well for starters it means getting to the Mission in the
middle of the night and cooking over 600 fried eggs and, in particular,
providing tea with 5 sugars to one toothless but beaming chap.  All this and
then heading of to the day job.

Well done guys, you're doing us all proud ...and the shirts are looking pretty good
too.
