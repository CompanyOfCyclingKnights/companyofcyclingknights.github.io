## Baggy and Nigel make the trip to Chelmsford

As part of our goal to get money out to our charities as quickly as
possible Baggy and Nigel made the trip from London to Chelmsford to
present a cheque for Â£333 to the Chelmsford Sea Cadets.

This is part of the generous sponsorship of the people at [Canary Wharf Group
](https://canarywharf.com/).  

61 Sea Cadets including 12 Royal Marine Cadets were present along with
their commanding officer Lieutenant Seb Briton.

The Unit are riding high at the moment having just won the Eastern
District Advex competition.  It's great to see young people able to
challenge themselves in such a positive way. 

Well done to all involved.

It's worth pointing out that all the money we're raising as part of this
ride is going directly to the our three charities.  We're paying for the
entire trip ourselves.

Rather than go through a tour operator, we're
self organised so any money raised goes exactly to the people that
really need it.
