As the most important member of our backup crew Keith plays an indispensable role in the team.

Well I can now report that he is also the proud owner of a First Aid at Work certificate earned aboard HMS Excellence.

It gives us all a bit of confidence knowing that in the unlikely situation there are any mishaps you'll be able to patch us up.

Well done Keith.

ps For those interested the cover photo for this post is the Swedish band First Aid Kit.  I thought they looked a bit more interesting than an actual first aid kit.
