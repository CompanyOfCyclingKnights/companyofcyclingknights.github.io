## Everything's coming together nicely.

We'd like to once again thank you, our sponsors, for your support.
You'll be very pleased to know we've decided to present any money that
comes into us directly to our charities as soon as it's available.

We're very pleased to announce that today Nigel was able to present a
cheque to the Sue Miller at the Whitechapel
Mission for Â£333.

Sue has been the manager of the Mission for 32 years, providing help to
those with nowhere else to turn.

This is part of the generous sponsorship of the people at [Canary Wharf Group
](https://canarywharf.com/).  We'll be presenting cheques from them to The Sea
Cadets and No Second Night Out over the next few days, stay tuned for
more information.
