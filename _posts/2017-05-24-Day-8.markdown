## Morning Lows

The morning depart was a hard one as we had to say good bye to the one
of the team over breakfast at the less than salubrious YHA Milton Keynes
Bill, medically retired from the ride wished us well as we made our
final checks of ourselves and the bikes that morning.

A very difficult good bye from both points – Bill, not a person to admit
defeat, I can only imagine was not in total agreement to the advice and
proved to be a very difficult decision for him. In addition, it proved
to be a hard good bye from those still taking part as Bill was the sole
person responsible for getting us all together and was to be sorely
missed throughout the remainder of this epic adventure.

However, the remainder of the ride proved to be a bit quieter!

## Midday was OK

More flat riding and negotiating cycle lanes on the way out of Milton
Keynes was too come.

The beautiful surroundings of the country side through to the Cotswolds
made for a much nicer back drop in what can only be described as Sahara
like conditions. The weather had so far been great, but as we headed
along the south west corridor it seems to heat up even more.

Sun cream was in plentiful supply, so to the water and please don’t
mention the Lucozade – which by now was proving difficult to face.

Two of the crew, Mike and Fitz had the added incentive of a home cooked
meal and good night’s rest to look forward to – and not to be out done,
the rest of us were promised the welcome opportunity of getting some kit
washed and replenishment of dwindling cake supplies.

A big thank you to Mike’s mum !

## Evening Highs

As we neared the end, I must admit I was not looking forward to another
stay care of the Youth Hostel Association.

However, when we arrived I could only described it as a Palace. The
three rooms on offer were split between the five of us needing them.

Beds were comfy, sheets clean and even the wet room toilet/shower was a
welcome sight.

A brief liquid replenishment was undertaken and followed by carb
loading. (2 pints of San Migeul and pasta/meatballs for me) made for a
very happy and tired Dave and I had the best night sleep so far.
