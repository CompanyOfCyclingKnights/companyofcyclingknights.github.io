Another month another group training ride.  This time to the famous [Blue Egg](http://www.theblueegg.co.uk/index.html) in Great Bardfield.


The Blue Egg is a cafe well known for both its cake and its famous clientele, being a popular stop with pros such as Alex Dowsett, Mark Cavendish and Bradley Wiggins ...and us.

Despite a cold, foggy start we had a good ride, managing about 90km (56 miles).

This time of year road miles seem to count double and I'm mostly happy that no one crashed again.

Well done chaps.
