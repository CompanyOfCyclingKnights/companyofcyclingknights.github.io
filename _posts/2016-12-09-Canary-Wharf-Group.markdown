The brilliant people at Canary Wharf Group have just donated £1,000 to
our causes!

All the money we're collecting goes straight to [The Whitechapel
Mission](https://www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/companyofcyclingknights),
[Chelmsford Sea
Cadets](https://www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/companyofcyclingknights2)
and [St Mungo's No Second Night
Out](https://www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/companyofcyclingknights3).

We're really proud to have Canary Wharf Group on board and with their help we can
really make a difference.
